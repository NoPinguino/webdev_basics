        <p>
          The Browser Object Model (BOM) is the set of objects provided by the
          web browser that allows JavaScript to interact with the browser
          environment beyond the content of the page itself. While the DOM
          focuses on the document’s structure, the BOM includes objects like
          window, navigator, location, history, and screen, which give
          developers access to features such as opening new tabs, detecting the
          user’s device, navigating to new URLs, or interacting with the
          browser’s history. In essence, the BOM acts as the bridge between
          JavaScript and the browser’s functionality, enabling scripts to
          control and respond to the environment in which a webpage runs.
